# Coding Standards

Language-specific coding instructions and pre-PR code review agents for bash, Bicep, C#, PowerShell, Python, Rust, and Terraform projects

## Overview

Enforce language-specific coding conventions and best practices across your projects, with pre-PR code review agents for catching functional defects early. This collection provides instructions for bash, Bicep, C#, PowerShell, Python, Rust, and Terraform that are automatically applied based on file patterns, plus agents that review branch diffs before opening pull requests.
